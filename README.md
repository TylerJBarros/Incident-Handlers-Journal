# Incident-Handlers-Journal
<h2>Description</h2>
I worked on and completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate in the spring of 2025. During the certification process, I completed an activity in which I reviewed the details of security incidents and documented them in an incident handler’s journal. Each entry included the timestamp of the incident, a description of the event, the tools used, the five W’s (Who, what, when, where, and why), and any additional notes on the incident. Other entries describe labs that have been completed in security tools.
